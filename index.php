/**
 * "Routes" have nothing particularly to do with MVC.
 * A "route" as it is colloquially understood is some function/class/code that resolves a URL
 * to an executable piece of code, usually a controller. Well, you can have that "for free"
 * with PHP's standard behaviour by using URLs like /controllers/foo-controller.php,
 * in which is code which will execute a controller. Your controller doesn't even need to be a class,
 * it just needs to be something which receives a request and can decide which model actions to
 * invoke and/or what view/response to send.
 * That's all MVC is about: having a core model which contains everything your app can "do",
 * having views separately from that which provide a UI for your model, and lastly having
 * a controller which acts on user input (here: HTTP requests). That separation is simply so
 * you can adapt your app (the model) to different scenarios easily by swapping out the UI (view)
 * and input handlers (controllers). Nothing in that prescribes the use of classes, routes or anything else.
